# Vigil-Eye
Vigil Eye is a Python-based drowsiness detection system that monitors eye movements in real-time using facial landmarks. It triggers audio alerts when signs of fatigue are detected. Built with OpenCV, dlib, and Tkinter, the app provides a simple, efficient solution to help prevent drowsiness-related accidents.
